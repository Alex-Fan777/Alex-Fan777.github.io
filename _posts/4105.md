-f frequency: Set the center frequency, where frequency is the desired frequency in Hz. For example, -f 916e6 sets the center frequency to 916 MHz.
-s samplerate: Set the sample rate, where samplerate is the desired sample rate in Hz. For example, -s 2e6 sets the sample rate to 2 MHz.
-n num_samples: Set the number of samples to capture, where num_samples is the desired number of samples. For example, -n 1000000 sets the number of samples to one 
million.
-g gain: Set the gain, where gain is the desired receiver gain in dB. Different hardware may support different gain ranges. For example, -g 20 sets the gain to 20 dB.
