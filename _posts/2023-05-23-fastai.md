## The explaination of T-SNE
Accordding to the defination, T-SNE is an uncertain or random algorithm, which is why the results of each run will change slightly. Even if it cannot preserve the 
variance in each run, you can use hyperparameter adjustment to preserve the distance between each class. This algorithm involves many calculations and calculations.
Therefore, this algorithm requires a lot of time and space to calculate

How can we understand it quickly?
T-SNE is mainly used for dimensionality reduction of data and has a wide range of applications.

If you simply project the data onto one of the coordinate axes, you will get a messy pile of data, and the clustering information between the original data will also
be lost.

Essentially, t-SNE is about finding a projection method that preserves the clustering information between data after dimensionality reduction.

Assuming we arrange these points in a random order on the x-axis.

T-SNE starts moving these points until they gather into clusters.

Where should it move to for the first point? Should we move a bit to the left or a bit to the right?
![image](https://github.com/Alex-Fan777/Alex-Fan777.github.io/assets/132428764/ec0216d0-7812-4dc0-8d74-ff728d063f8a)
As it belongs to the red cluster, it is moved closer to those red dots. At the same time, blue and orange dots will be dispersed and moved to the left due to being
farther away from the point in high-dimensional space. In this way, the red dots will gather, while the orange and blue dots will separate.

At each step (corresponding to one of the points), this point in the low dimensional space will be attracted by its neighboring points in the high dimensional space,
while being dispersed by non neighboring points in the high dimensional space.

## Codes in Fast ai
First, we should quick preview application. Also, if we want to process the images, we can also do it.

In the above figure, the CPU first executes the item_ Tfms, unify image size, and then execute batch using GPU_ Tfms performs data augmentation, resulting in fast 
execution speed
Note: Data augmentation in Fastai is only effective for the training set. In addition to randomly resized loop, it captures the local positions of random positions 
in the training set to crop, and for the validation set, it captures the center positions of squares that it can capture
It is convenient to perform data cleaning after establishing a model, as the function shown in the following figure can be used to select

In Fastai, the learn object is an instance of the Learner class, representing a model trainer. The Learner class provides many parameters to configure and control
the training process of the model.

dls: Data Loaders object, specifying the dataset used for training and validation.

Model: Model architecture or model object, used to define the structure and parameters of the model.

loss_ Func: loss function, used to measure the performance of the model in the training process.

opt_ Func: Optimizer function used to update the weight parameters of the model.

Metrics: Evaluation metrics used to measure the performance of a model during training and validation.

Wd: weight decay parameter, used to control the regularization degree of the model.

CBS: A list of callback functions used to perform additional operations and custom behaviors during the training process.

Splitter: A function used to segment a model, dividing its parameters into trainable and untrained parts.

Path: The path where the model is saved.

model_ Dir: The directory where the model is saved.

In this case, we chose the wd and pretrained, change the loss function from resnet18 to resnet 50, which means have more number of layers.
Also, weo use fine_tune to train the model for many times, which can help us to modify the value and get a better data.

For learning rate, the default learning rate is most common and useful , which means we don't need to change it any more. However, in order to find the how the 
learning rate influence the model, I decide to find the best learning rate like this.

And I also make the learning rate change from 1e-3 to 1e-5, which can show the difference between the high learning rate and low learning rate. 
![image](https://github.com/Alex-Fan777/Alex-Fan777.github.io/assets/132428764/a7b74ecf-a4b6-45c6-ad65-804c36386984)

After testing, I think the default is the best. The changed one have more valid_loss, which means it it not that suitable for all of the data in this model.

Then, I try to do the confusion matrix like this

Also, View easily confused categories

According to the defination, In artificial intelligence, confusion matrix is a visual tool, especially for supervised learning, which is generally called matching
matrix in unsupervised learning. In the image accuracy evaluation, it is mainly used to compare the classification results with the actual measured values.
The accuracy of the classification results can be displayed in a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix is calculated by comparing the position and classification
of each measured pixel with the corresponding position and classification in the classified image.

In the field of machine learning, confusion matrix is also called possibility matrix or error matrix. Confusion matrix is a visual tool, especially used for
supervised learning. It is generally called matching matrix in unsupervised learning. In the image accuracy evaluation, it is mainly used to compare the 
classification results with the actual measured values. The accuracy of the classification results can be displayed in a confusion matrix.
Meaning of confusion matrix:
Each column of the confusion matrix represents the prediction category, and the total number of each column represents the number of data predicted for that
category;
Each row represents the true category of the data, and the total number of data instances in each row represents the number of data instances in that category; 
The numerical values in each column represent the number of predicted classes of real data.

## fast ai model
For the fast ai model, we can choose a lot like this:

We can also use the functions to find the parameters for better loss.
