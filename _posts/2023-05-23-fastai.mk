##The explaination of T-SNE
Accordding to the defination, T-SNE is an uncertain or random algorithm, which is why the results of each run will change slightly. Even if it cannot preserve the 
variance in each run, you can use hyperparameter adjustment to preserve the distance between each class. This algorithm involves many calculations and calculations.
Therefore, this algorithm requires a lot of time and space to calculate

How can we understand it quickly?
T-SNE is mainly used for dimensionality reduction of data and has a wide range of applications. For simplicity, the following is an example of t-SNE reducing 2D 
data to one-dimensional.
